 If youâ€™ve always wanted to use some kind of
 inheritance mechanism for your structs,
 Swift 5.1 is going to make you very happy!
 
 Using the new KeyPath-based dynamic member
 lookup, you can implement some pseudo-inheritance,
 where a type inherits the API of another one ðŸŽ‰
 
 (However, be careful, Iâ€™m definitely not
 advocating inheritance as a go-to solution ðŸ™ƒ)
